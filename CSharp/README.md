# Microsoft Bot Builder Calling Overview

Microsoft Bot Builder Calling is a powerful framework that extends the Bot Builder core library to provide the capability for IVR scenarios such as playing prompts, recordings and etc.

The code itself uses Nuget which restores all needed files when built.  If you want to build the documentation, 
you will need to install [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/), [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) and [Mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/)
Here are step by step instructions:

1. Download and install from the [Doxygen Windows Installer](http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.8.11-setup.exe).
2. Download and install from the [GraphViz Windows Installer](http://graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/windows/graphviz-2.38.msi)
3. Download and install from the [Mscgen Windows Installer](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/software/mscgen_0.20.exe)

If versions have changed you can find the latest through the core pages above, although you may need to update the Doxygen config file with the appropriate version of tools.
